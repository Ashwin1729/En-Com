This is an E-Commerce website known as Real-Meal. 


Here I have implemented the funcitionality of LOGIN and SIGN-UP of the users. Once user is logged-in or signed-up, he/she can choose any desired meal of his/her preference (currently only limited food data is present on database which is manually created by me). 

Users can add the food items to cart which will show all the selected food items, their quantity, total price etc. 

You can order the food by providing you details which will be stored in the database.


Technologies used - 

Next.js, Application wide state management, Firebase Authentication Rest API (for login and signup), Firebase Realtime database(to store meals and orders data).

Definately feel free to go and explore, any improvement would be definitely appreciated.
